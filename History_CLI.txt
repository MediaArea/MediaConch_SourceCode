x Fix regression on Windows with directory names beginning by n or r.

Version 18.03, 2018-03-19

x Do not apply policies to attachments
x Print error if data directory isn't writable And polices can be applied on fields provided by new MediaInfo library:
+ AV1: support of AOmedia AV1 based on latest specifications draft, raw (OBU) and in MKV
+ DPX: endianess, packing mode, compression mode
+ MXF: detection and parsing of ProRes (SMPTE RDD 44)
+ MXF: HDR metadata support
+ AVC: add consumer camera recording date/time
+ AVC: add consumer camera model name and iris F number
+ JPEG: ICC parsing, display of ICC color space
+ MediaInfo JSON output
x colour description: trying (again!) to have more coherent labeling
x AAC: SBR parsing issue with 3+ channel streams, with sometimes false-positive PS detection
x DPX: some elements in trace were wrongly displayed (wrong endianess)
+ License change
